# Fiber

Fiber is the foundation technology that powers the MeshX platform. Fiber is composed of a kernel as well as a small set of userspace services, drivers, and libraries in [/system](/system) necessary for the system to boot, talk to hardware, load userspace processes and run them, etc. MeshX builds a much larger platform on top of this foundation.
